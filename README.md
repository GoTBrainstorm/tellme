## TellMe
=========================
TellMe is a small informational mod for Minecraft. It has registry dumps for most if not all
of the registries Minecraft has, and it has some other commands such as locating blocks,
entities or block entities in a given area, or outputting the NBT data and some other information
of the block or entity yo uare looking at, or the item yo uare olding, or the biome you are in etc.

It is mainly meant for modpack makers, mod developers or other users who need some technical
information about the above mentioned types of things.
